## Overall Description
The Do Not Disturb Proxemic is a digital and visual system designed to deter individuals from interrupting you while you are studying, working, or simply seeking solitude. By dynamically signaling approaching individuals to reconsider entering your room, it ensures your privacy and minimizes unwanted disturbances.

## Storyboard
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="drive-download-20241119T064848Z-001/Nov 18 2024_241118_234823_3.jpg" style="width: 45%; height: auto; display: inline-block; margin: 10px;">

  <p>
When no user is present, the information display board remains blank. As a user approaches, the board progressively displays information in three levels based on their proximity to the display/door:

  Level Red: Visible from afar, it clearly indicates that the user inside should not be disturbed.
  Level Yellow: As the user moves closer, additional context is provided, offering more detailed information about the user's status.
  Level Green: When the user is very close, the board displays a fully detailed description of the user’s activity or availability.
  
This system ensures clear and respectful communication while maintaining privacy.
